JallahTech is a company that import and sales used phone in Kigali/ Rwanda.

Regarding the rapid development of Rwanda in all sectors and ICT in particular, my idea was
born to sell used phones not only to minimize budget but also to make phones affordable here
in Rwanda. The Idea is to sell used phones and offer free delivery anywhere in Kigali. Nowadays
all services from local government to all public administration, from public institutions to private
institutions are offered online. No need to form a queue to executive office get served, almost
all services are offered on IREMBO platform. The same goes with banking where you can
deposit, withdraw, send and receive money with just a phone. The above factors and ones that
are not mentioned emphasized the urge needs for telephones to access all those benefits
comes with it.
The reason we are selling used phones (second hand) is because we want to give people the
same experience of having those devices without complaining how old they are because we
maintain them before reselling them. In additional to that we will be offering free delivery to
those who are in Kigali and for those who are outside of Kigali will be charged fare. The goal is
to make phones affordable at all costs.
Normally, people who sell used phones build a reputation to sell old and malfunctioning phones
regarding client’s complaints. They complain that those phones’ battery life is too short and
most of them have scratches. And this is where our idea comes in play where we will be not
only repair them but also, we will be replacing affected parts of phone with new ones just to
make them look like new ones.
